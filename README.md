jethomson: The motivation behind this fork is to (1) get development working in PlatformIO when the default fatfs created by PlatformIO is incompatible with this project, and (2) create an example ino file for the LILYGO T-RGB. generate_fatfs.py is a extra script that runs during Build Filesystem Image and Upload Filesystem Image, which creates a CircuitPython compatible fatfs. The example for the LILYGO T-RGB resides in examples/OneEye_LILYGO_T_RGB_ST7701S/OneEye_LILYGO_T_RGB_ST7701S.ino. No changes have been made to files in the src folder. 
 I wouldn't recommend adding code that writes to the filesystem since CircuitPython does not use a fatfs with wear leveling.<br><br>

# Adafruit Monster Eyes [![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Monster_Eyes/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Monster_Eyes/actions)[![Documentation](https://github.com/adafruit/ci-arduino/blob/master/assets/doxygen_badge.svg)](http://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_Monster_Eyes/html/index.html)

Arduino library to show moving, blinking eyes on various displays. Ported from the [M4_Eyes for the MONSTER M4SK by Phil B. for Adafruit Industries](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/main/M4_Eyes)

Just like with M4 Eyes, you'll load CircuitPython onto your board. Then, drag and drop your chosen [EYES artwork](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/main/M4_Eyes/eyes) to the CIRCUITPY drive.
Load the a sketch with the Monster Eyes library, either by compiling or via UF2, onto your board. You should see the eyes blink to life. 

## MCU and Display Support with Expected Performance

The following microcontrollerss have been tested:

* RP2040
* RP2350
* ESP32-S2
* ESP32-S3

TFT support currently includes:
* ST7789
* GC9A01A

DVI output is only available on RP2 (PicoDVI). You can also sync two boards together. Examples are available for PicoDVI and Qualia.

Expected performance (avg):

| MCU:Display    |  1 eye  |  2 eyes |
| :------------- | :-----: | ------: |
| RP2040 : TFT   | 24 FPS  | 13 FPS  |
| RP2350 : TFT   | 37 FPS  | 19 FPS  |
| RP2040 : DVI   | 180 FPS | 100 FPS |
| ESP32-S2 : TFT | 32 FPS  | 16 FPS  |
| ESP32-S3 : TFT | 39 FPS  | 20 FPS  |

On average, adding a second eye will halve the frame rate seen while showing one eye.
